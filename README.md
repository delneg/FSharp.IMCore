# FSharp.System.Collections.Immutable


This repo hosts opinionated view on F# usage of System.Collections.Immutable

Benchmarks showed that sometimes System.Collections.Immutable datastructures can be faster than ones implemented in FSharp.Core.

This library tries to provide the same API as the standard collection (aside for the `IM` prefix), 
in order to be able to simply replace i.e. `Set` with `IMSet` in the whole project and make no other changes - with some perfomance boost gained.



Benchmarks will be added below for the reference of which structures to use in which cases.
